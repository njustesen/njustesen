# About

I am an AI researcher at [modl.ai](http://modl.ai) working on game-playing and content-generating algorithms. I am especially fascinated by algorithms that can learn to play difficult games, and I wrote my dissertation on exactly that topic. I was advised by Prof. [Sebastian Risi](http://sebastianrisi.com) at the IT University of Copenhagen and was part of the Center for [Computer Games Research](https://game.itu.dk/)) and the [Robotics Evolution and Art Laboratory](https://real.itu.dk/). During my PhD, I also had the pleasure of working with [Julian Togelius](http://julian.togelius.com) at the [Game Innovation Lab](http://game.engineering.nyu.edu/) at the NYU School of Engineering as well [Jean-Baptiste Mouret](https://members.loria.fr/JBMouret/) at INRIA in Nancy, France.

The last few years I have also been organizing an AI competition called [Bot Bowl](http://bot-bowl.com); a competition where people can submit bots that compete in the board game [Blood Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Bowl). This game is orders of magnitiude more complex than Go, and while it seems simpler than StarCraft, bots cannot rely in their quick reactions and perfect motor skills.
